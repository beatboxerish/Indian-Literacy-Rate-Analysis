# Education in India

## About :

I was interested in knowing more about how the literacy rate 
in Indian states was affected and what factors could we work
on to help improve the literacy rate of different states.
I found some data from kaggle which contained census data
regarding the literacy rate in diffrent Indian states and the
education indicators, eg: No of teachers, no. of schools, etc.,
for Indian states and Union territories for 2015-16. Thus, using
that data, I tried to answer these 3 questions in depth: 

* Which states have the highest and the lowest literacy rates?
* How are the top 3 states different from the bottom 3 states and what factors can the bottom 3 states work on to increase their literacy 
rate? (Explored using elementary dataset only)
* Make a regression model for allowing for prediction of overall literacy rate using only education level indicators(eg: School types, 
no. of teachers across different categories, school facilites etc.). Take any 3 states as the validation set. Which technique gives us the 
best model? 

The last point above is not exactly a question, but I figure that it can be used to predict the literacy rate based on education indicators
each year as the literacy rate is only calculated once during census but the eduction indicators are calculated every year. Thus helping in
understanding how the literacy rate changes due to the change in education indicators.

I have also created a medium post on this analysis that ca n be found here :
